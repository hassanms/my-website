Hassan, a professional full-stack developer with a passion for building next-gen SaaS solutions.\n\nI specialize in TypeScript, Next.js, the MERN stack, Django, Material-UI, Tailwind, and SaaS AI. With 7 years of industry experience, Iâ€™ve worked on projects ranging from MVPs to complex enterprise solutions.\n\nWhat sets me apart is my focus on the business use case rather than just delivering an application. I aim to understand the problem you want to solve and ensure that my work contributes directly to that solution. Oh, and did I mention? I'm also a Microsoft-certified Python developer.\n\nOne of the highlights of my career was being a founding engineer at a UK-based startup in the visual collaboration space. Over four years, I helped the company secure half a million dollars in funding. It was an incredible experience, facing new challenges every day and working hard to overcome them.\n\nIn my free time, Iâ€™m quite fond of reading self-help and business books. Currently, Iâ€™m reading $100M Offers by Alex Hormozi, which is helping me think about creating irresistible offers.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a business partner who can bring real value to your company and make your life easier, I'd love to collaborate. Let's connect and discuss how I can help you achieve your goals.\n\nThanks for reading. I look forward to working with you soon.","resume":{"tagline":"ðŸ‘‹  I'm a software engineer, product designer.","description":"I have delivered world-class user experiences to millions of people.
